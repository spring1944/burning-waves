Pr.7 Destroyer

Project 7 was a destroyer class means to replace the aging Novik class. It was designed in the 1930s and was quite modern at the start of the war. Its main drawback was weak AA armament - its main guns weren't effective in AA role (unlike US 127mm for ex.)

Weapons:
4 x 130mm B-13 (the direct successor to 130mm guns seen on Russian Empire's light cruisers during WW1)
2 x 76.2mm 34-K (adaptation of 3-K 76.2mm AA gun for ship use, which itself is a licensed adaptation of German Flak15 from WW1)
4 x 37mm 61-K
2 x 12.7mm DShK
2 x 2 x 12.7mm Vickers (or any other 12.7 MG, depending on what was available at the moment)
2 x 3 x 533mm 39-Yu torpedo launchers (little more that upsized launchers from Novik destroyers, still deadly even to the largest of ships)

Additional equipment:
lend-leased radar (Project 7s were among the first ships to receive that, right after the battleships and cruisers. USSR had own radars, but those were too expensive to place on destroyers, some cruisers had them though)
hydro-accoustic sensor to detect moving subs
minesweeping paravan
minelaying equipment
4 depth charge launchers
ballistic calculator for the main guns (though no such device for AA guns), central rangefinding post

Protection: gun crews are protected by shields, up to 25mm of armor (protects against any kind of MG fire or fragments, but little more). Ship hull has no armor protection - armor belts are the thing for cruisers and heavier ships. Still, it's quite large and can survive some hits.
This ship is a valid target for torpedoes.
