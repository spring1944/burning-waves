Flower class corvette
At the start of WW2 British navy found itself unable to afford the numer of escort ships required to provide for safe Atlantic convoy passage. Destroyers were a bit of overkill for the job (although sometimes even battleship escorted convoys), and anyway there were not enough destroyers for the job. Military shipyards were busy and had no spare capacity for escort ships.
The solution came in the form of Flower corvette. This ship was based on a commercial whalecatcher hull, which meant it could be built in civilian shipyards. It underwent several modifications during the war, was built in several countries (UK, France, Canada and USA) and served in several navies (British, Canadian, USN, Free France, Free Polish etc. and even the Kriegsmarine who captured 4 nearly-completed ships after the fall of France).
Weapons: 1 low-velocity 4-inch gun (mainly intended against surfaced subs), 1 single-barrel pom-pom, later models also received 2 20mm Oerlikons (or additionally replaced the pompom with twin Oerlikon), Hedgehog and depth charges.
