Vorpostenboot

At the end of 1940 Germany 'suddenly' found itself in control of much of Europe, including the lenghty coast line. Kriegsmarine had not nearly enough ships to patrol such space, and German shipyards could not hope to produce so many new patrol ships. The solution was found by refitting civilian ships for patrol use, especially fishing vessels huge numbers of which were requisitioned. Those were slow and not very durable, but they were many, there were more than 800 Vorpostenboote produced during the war. No two such ships were alike, but some fishing boat designs were more widespread than others, so some form of standartization could be achieved.
Typical armament of a Vorpostenboot included 1-2 88mm guns, 1-2 37mm guns, 2-7 20mm guns, some 13mm HMGs and depth charges. Some boats received 4-barrel 20mm flakvierling turrets instead of single 20mm guns.
