Tacoma class frigate
PF-1 Tacoma class ships were the result of an adaptation of British River class frigate to US production techniques. Riveting was replaced by welding (which cut down construction time considerably), 2 British 4" guns were replaced by 3 3" ones, and some minor adjustements to hull shape were made.
The ships were built by civilian shipyards in order to accelerate their construction. As a result, their design was somewhat less sturdy than is expected of a warship. Considering that their main mission was convoy escort and anti-submarine warfare, that was acceptable.
96 ships of this class were completed, with 21 of them being lent to Royal Navy where they were designated Colony class frigates. USSR also received 28 of them, they served in the Pacific and were named EK (probably Eskortny Korabl = Escort Ship).
Armament is intended mainly for anti-aircraft use, while 3-inch guns are considered universal, their usefulness against any kind of large vessel (destroyer and up in size) is very questionable. They were considered quite good at AA role however, when paired with radar rangefinder. It was estimated than one 3-inch gun exceeds a twin Bofors in effectiveness and even closely approaches the quad Bofors, being much lighter than the latter.
