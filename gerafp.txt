Weapons:
(for detailed German naval gun stats go right there: http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_Main.htm)
(I'm not 100% sure I picked the right 88mm guns, there are a lot of very similar ones and many were used on small warships)
2 x 8.8 cm/45 (3.46") SK C/30 (those are NOT 8.8 FlaK, they are naval guns instead. 88mm is a traditional German naval gun caliber since 19th century).
1 x 3.7 cm/57 (1.5") Flak M43 (Rheinmetall 108 MK103 aircraft cannon modified for ship use)
2 x 2 cm/65 (0.79") C/38 AA MG (single mount)
2 x 2 cm/65 (0.79") C/38 AA MG FlaK 35 (quad mount)

All in all a very powerful short-range AA armament for such a small ship. 88mm guns make it dangerous to armored things. Lack of enclosed turrets makes it vulnerable to small arms however. 88mm can fire AA, however they aren't true FlaK and so have much lower turs rates which makes targetting fast planes very hard.

Weapon arrangement for scriptring:

Weapon1 - Front 88mm
Weapon2 - Rear 88mm
Weapon3 - 37mm
Weapon4 - front quad mount
Weapon5 - rear quad mount
Weapon6 - single 20mm
Weapon7 - single 20mm

Movement class - the same as the Soviet monitor, minWaterDepth=6. In fact both those ships need only 1 meter of depth to operate.
HP - less than a monitor (nearly all of the AFP crew work in the open and so are very vulnerable), but still considerable (AP rounds are not very good against this, large caliber HE however should make short work of it)
