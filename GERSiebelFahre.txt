Siebel Fahre
When Germans planned operation Seelowe (invasion of British Isles), they found they lacked anything near the amount of landing craft required for the task. To address this problem, a request was issued for a cheaps and fast to build landing craft that could cross the Channel. Among those who submitted designs was oberst (colonel) Siebel of Luftwaffe. His craft was built around 2 pontoons used by the army pioneer units to construct bridges, using 3 aircraft engines for propulsion. All of those parts were readily available, so the design was accepted and production started.
Initially the craft was powered by aircraft engines and aircraft propellers, which allowed for speeds up to 14 km/h. However, it used fuel like a 3-engine plane would, which was too much. So a redesigned version was developed, which used 'normal' ship screws. The speed dropped to 12 km/h, but fuel consumption dropped much more, so this craft went into production. Both air propeller and water screw crafts co-existed.
