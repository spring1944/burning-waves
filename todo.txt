***Replace current "water trail" FX with something that doesn't look like ass (no offense to whoever made it).***

***Standardization of scripting (LUA? Compartmentalized script parts? Simplification whenever possible?)***

***Submarines & their Three Stages/Dive Depths***

-Fully Submerged: Submarine detectable only by SONAR (inaccurate). Has no LOS, no collision (can pass under ships) and can not shoot. Can be damaged by depth charges but not by bombs, torpedos or surface fire.

-Periscope Depth: Submarine can be detected by sight but not radar (has cloak range). Has full LOS and can shoot torpedos. Can not be damaged by bombs or surface fire, but can be damaged by torpedos and depth charges. 

-Surfaced: Submarine can be detected by Radar (and LOS ofc). Has full LOS and can shoot torpedos and its deck guns (if any). Can be damaged by all weapons. 

***Mines***

Depth Charges and Hedgehog Projectors for ASW ships.

***Damage System for secondary effects such as:

-Torpedos: Affect propulsion (slow down/immobilize); cause HP "bleed"
-Surface Fire/Bombs: Affect weapons, radar, LoS, etc; cause massive secondary explosions.

***Interface***

Currently all cursor interface occurs with actual terrain rather than the surface of water, making things confusing when you're using anything but straight top-down camera views due to the angle. 

***Aircraft Carriers***

Management system for their aircraft. Initial system in place.
