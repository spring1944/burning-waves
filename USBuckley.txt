Buckley Class Destroyer Escort

This ship was built mainly as a submarine hunter. However, it carried a triple torpedo launcher (with no spare torpedoes, unlike larger destroyers) which made it quite dangerous even for the large enemy ships (unlike the otherwise similar Tacoma class for ex.). Another distinctive feature of the Buckley is the Chicago Piano - a quadruple 1.1" AA gun, which by 1945 was phased out of use on most of the ships except this class. Weapon was more powerful than the Oerlikon, but prone to jamming.
