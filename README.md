##Burning Waves: Terrors on the High Seas: For Death and Glory


This is a loose mod of Spring: 1944 focusing on naval combat.

There is only one side: development was focused on exploring fun naval combat and discovering unit roles.

##Playing

Currently in fairly rough shape (old!), best bet is to post on the spring1944.net forums for help.

##Gameplay
The game runs for 10 minutes. The team with the most kills by unit value at the end of that period wins. All teams operate on a fixed income, with an unkillable, invisible base of production.

##Units

* Torpedo boat
* Light cruiser
* Destroyer
* Main Battleship
* Aircraft Carrier (WOOO, call in some planes!)
* Fleet supply/repair ship
