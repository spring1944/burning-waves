Fletcher class destroyer

Fletcher class destroyers are often considered to be the best destroyer type of the war. This is mainly thanks to their versatile 5-inch guns which could be used agains air targets and had really high rate of fire compared to that of other nation's comparable weapons. Radar-controlled proximity fuses helped to improve AA power of those guns even further.
The ships had very heavy short-range AA weapons as well, this was desperately needed at the Pacific where Japanese at first had air superiority. By the end of war that was no longer the case, yet numerous light AA guns became even more useful because they could stop a kamikaze plane before it could hit the ship.
5-tube torpedo launchers weren't anything out of the ordinary on the Pacific because Japanese ships, too, had very heavy torpedo armament. That still looked like an overkill in European waters.
