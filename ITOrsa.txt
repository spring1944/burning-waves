Orsa class escort destroyer (sometimes named torpedo boat)

Built as a development on the earlier Spica class, which were made to exploit a clause in the Washington Naval treaty that ships under 600 tons are not limited in either number or total tonnage. Resulting ships were not well suited for ocean voyages, but were ideal for Mediterrannean theater.
Orsa has reduced main gun number (from 3 to 2) compared to Spica, but improved AA artillery. Torpedoes are arranged in such a way that only 2 of the total 4 can be fired at either side, greatly limiting their power (common drawback found in many Italian light ships).
Orsa class was not numerous (4 units), but the next Ciclone class was nearly similar and was built in considerable numbers.
Ship was able to both lay mines and serve as a minesweeper (to a limited extent - the draught is a bit too large for that).
