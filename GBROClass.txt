O class destroyer

O and P classes were the first 'emergency program' wartime destroyers.
At the start of WW2 Britain suddenly found itself in need of a lot more destroyers than it had, so much so that 50 old WW1 ships were obtained from the US. Carefully designed pre-war ships were good, but their AA protection proved to be inadequate (British 50cal machineguns were way weaker than such weapons of other nations, and pom-poms weren't much good either). At the same time, it was found that torpedoes play a much lesser role in modern war than was expected, both because of increased range of artillery combat and torpedo unreliability. So it was decided to drop one set of torpedo tubes and install a heavy AA gun instead. At first main artillery was to be 4.7inch guns, and indeed some of the ships received those, but the rest received 4-inch artillery because of weapons shortage.
As British ships, the destroyers had reasonably good seakeeping abilities (unlike German units). In artillery department it was on paper weaker than a German Z-type destroyer (or for that matter a Russian Pr.7/7U or the US Fletcher), but in a real fight low reliability of German equipment often meant there just wasn't a German destroyer where and when it was needed, unlike the British one. In a close-range engagement a 4-torpedo salvo wasn't much worse than a 6- or 8-torpedo one of which the other nation ships were capable (even 1 torpedo hit is a crippling injury for most any vessel).
