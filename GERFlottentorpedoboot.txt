Type 1939 Flottentorpedoboot.
An improvement over type 1935 and type 1937 classes.
In most other countries this would be called an escort destroyer or some such, but not in Germany. This craft is a coastal destroyer (ie it's not designed to sail in the high seas) heavily armed with torpedoes as well as some artillery and depth charges.
Main artillery is 105mm which roughly corresponds to 4-inch guns (found on most destroyers of all sides during WW1).
AA artillery is 2 x twin 37mm C30 guns (single shot only, no burst), 5 x 20mm guns and 1 x Flak-Vierling quad 20mm gun
Torpedoes are contained in 2 3-tube launchers.
In 1 on 1 fight this ship will likely lose to a full Allied destroyer... unless it can get into position for a torpedo attack, in which case both ships will most probably be dead. It's cheaper than a destroyer however, and nearly as deadly against smaller ships and aircraft.
Generally German destroyer force was an ORDER OF MAGNITUDE less numerous that British, and German destroyers were notoriously bad at sea-keeping (as in they often took weather damage when in the ocean), yet it was the UK who constantly felt the need for more of them because of U-Boat threat.
