THIS BE A MOTHERFUCKIN' GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT

--BRIEF OVERVIEW OF GAMEPLAY--

In this multiplayer-focused game, players battle one another utilizing fleets of naval warships, submarines and aircraft of various roles and capabilities.

At the beginning of a game players will be given a lump sum of "aquisition points" or whatever you want to call it to deploy their initial forces. As the game transpires players will continously receive more of these points in order to call in reinforcements.

Most combat will be between surface vessels, with submarines playing a secondary role. Likewise, aircraft, both carrier-borne and "coastal" aircraft will play a part, be it patrol/scouting, surface attack or air defense.

--GAMEPLAY MODES--

These are options for gameplay modes.

AQUISITION POINTS: The amount of aquisition points players get to spend on units.

DEPLOYMENT MODE:

Full Fleet - Players buy their entire fleet and air assets before the game starts and deploy them in one go.

Escalation - Players continuously receive aquisition points at a fixed rate until the amount of points runs out; they buy units during the course of the game.

VICTORY CONDITIONS:

Timer - After xx time runs out, game ends.

Annihilation - Destroy all of your opponent's ships until they have no more and no more aquisition points.

Strategic Points - Strategic points are placed on the map at random (on water). Holding more points than the enemy runs a counter, at the end of which you win.


--BRIEF OVERVIEW OF SPECIAL FEATURES THAT MAKE A SHIP RTS COOL--


*Torpedos can kill ||ANYTHING||. Even the smallest ships (Patrol Torpedo/Motor Torpedo Boats) can pack a few of these things and all it takes is one good hit to bring down any ship. So even if you're packing the latest ginormous Yamamoto-class battleship, a couple of PT boats could come zipping your way and pwn your face. 

*Ship Damage: Individual guns, turrets and other devices (engines, radar arrays, ammunition stores) can receive damage, knocking them out and potentially causing a massive, catastrophic explosion.

*Carrier and Land-Based Aircraft: Carriers will be able to directly deploy carrier aircraft in the form of fighters, dive bombers and torpedo bombers. Players will also have access to land-based aircraft sorties; generally land-based fighters have higher performance, and medium bombers and patrol/ASW planes will only be available from land. Some factions such as Germany will rely solely on land-based sorties. Land-based sorties will come with a deployment delay, opposed to carrier-based planes which can be launched immediately.

*Radar: Will play the same role it did during the war (and ironically how it works in OTA) by essentially being able to detect all but the smallest ships and aircraft beyond direct line-of-sight distance. Ships so equipped will be able to use this data for gun-laying to fire outside of LOS (if they have weapons with the required range). 

*Good ol' fashioned large fleet fights: Will be had. Battleship duels, massive naval armadas, destroyer flotillas and torpedo boat squadrons. For glory!

*Submarines will have three states:
- Submerged: The submarine is slowest submerged, and undetectable, but can not see anything or use any weapons. They will also have a "timer" that determines how long they can stay fully submerged as they must run on battery power as their diesel engines require oxygen.
- Periscope/Attack Depth: At this depth the submarine can see (through periscope) and attack targets with torpedos, and can also be seen, but not detected on radar; it is invulnerable to surface attack as shells simply detonate on the surface of the water.
- Surfaced: At this depth the submarine can be seen and detected on radar, and can use deck-mounted guns as well as torpedos against targets. Can be hit by surface guns.
At all depths submarines can be hit by depth charges, but obviously when fully submerged accurate targeting is next to impossible.

*Logistics will play an important role for some ships, particularly the smaller ships which can not hold infinite amounts of ammunition. Torpedo-armed ships are especially prone to running out of Torpedos. Supply Ships will be available. They will have a very small resupply radius, having to physically move up next to the ship they wish to resupply.

*Special Units: Each faction will have some unique traits, abilities or units which the others do not, such as:

-German "Milchkuh" Supply Submarine will allow Germany to re-arm U-Boats with a stealthy submergable submarine. They will need to surface fully in order to resupply. They will ONLY be able to resupply U-Boats; surface ships must rely on surface Supply ships to re-arm.

-German Fritz-X Guided Bomb: Carried by a medium bomber, this will allow Germany to bomb enemy ships from outside of anti-aircraft range. The bombs themselves however can be shot down, but are hard targets to hit.

-Japanese Kamikaze aircraft loaded with bombs and explosives can carry out suicide attacks against enemy ships, provided they can get through the anti-aircraft fire.

-Japanese Midget Submarines can remain undetected (cloaked) even at periscope depth, only revealing themselves when they fire one of their two torpedos at an unsuspecting target.
