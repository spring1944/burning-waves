Hunt II class Escort Destroyer

A ship mainly tasked with escorting coastal convoys in British water. Armament is geared towards anti-aircraft and anti-submarine role, though 6 4-inch guns make it a tough target for surface warships.
Hunt class was intended to be a ship that can perform escort duties and is smaller and cheaper than a full destroyer. Initial design had 3 2-gun mounts for 4-inch artillery. However, the ship proved to be top-heavy, so one of the main turrets had to be removed. Hunt II addressed the problem, and had 3 turrets. Hunt III had 1 turret removed yet again, and received a torpedo launcher in its place. Hunt IV (only 2 ships were built to this design) had 3 turrets AND a torpedo launcher.
The class proved badly suited for harsh ocean weather and so was mostly used in the coastal waters.
