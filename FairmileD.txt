Fairmile D MGB/MTB

British naval command felt that their Fairmile boats were inferior to the German S-Boats (being frequently outgunned by them). British MTBs only had machineguns as defensive armament (compared to 20mm on S-Boats), and while MGBs were armed well enough, they lacked the speed to catch fast Germans. Fairmile D was intended to be a cross between torpedo and gun boat, carrying powerful torpedo armament to deal with large ships as well as powerful artillery capable of dealing with S-Boats.
Unfortunately this meant it was slower than S-Boats, but not by much.
Overall this boat turned out as the most powerful small attack craft of the war.
