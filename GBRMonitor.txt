Roberts class monitor
The successor to the Erebus class WW1 monitors

Heavy monitors of such design were first devised during early WW1 years when it was discovered that Royal Navy battleships cannot provide effective fire support for the ground forces because they cannot get close enough to the shore (and also because they will get in German coastal batteries range should they even attempt this). To overcome this, specialized shallow-draught ships with heavy guns were built. Only 2 of those (the Erebus class) survived to the start of WW2, and that was considered an inadequate force.
Two of generally similar ships (although incorporating modern advancements in fire control) were ordered at the start of WW2. First (HMS Roberts) was completed in 1941, second (HMS Abercrombie) was completed in 1943.
Ships were armed with 2-gun 15" main caliber turrets removed from old WW1 battleships, and a variety of AA weapons. They had good electronics outfit for the time, even pom-poms were radar aimed.
The hull was specially designed to be highly resistant to mine and torpedo hits. The design was proved in combat more than once, with Abercrombie twice venturing into minefields, hitting some mines and being able to return back for repairs in one piece.
The ships were used on the European and North African theaters, they supported landings in North Africa, Sicily and France. At the end of war Abercrombie was sent to the Pacific to support the planned landing in Japan, but wasn't able to arrive there before war was over.

During WW2 Britain had 4 monitors with 15-inch guns active: Erebus, Terror, Roberts and Abercrombie. Of them HMS Terror was the only one lost in action.
Armor protection of those ships was quite good: up to 13 inches at the turret, and up to 5 inches on the main belt.
