Komsomolets torpedo boat
A light torpedo boat with 2 533mm tubes and 2 twin HMG turrets. Some boats had 23mm guns instead of HMGs installed, I'm not sure we want this.
The boat is virtually unprotected. It uses high-power gasoline engine, which means it's in danger of explosion should some shots penetrate fuel tanks (and if they hit the torpedoes... you get the idea)
On the bright side, this thing is lightning-fast - speed is it's main protection. And even the largest and heaviest of ships can die to a full salvo of 2 torpedoes, so it's highly dangerous.
