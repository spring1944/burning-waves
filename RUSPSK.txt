Brilliant class border guard ship
This design is based on Novik class destroyer hull (somewhat reduced in size). The ships were used for border guard duties, as the war started, they took an active part in it. While this ship can not compete with a 'real' destroyer in firepower or speed, it is considerably cheaper and somewhat smaller. It performs well in submarine hunter or convoy escort role.

Weapons:
1 x 102mm(4-inch)/60 m1911 naval gun
3 x 70-K 37mm AA gun in open mount (the same as 61-K light AA gun)
2 x 12.7mm HMG in open mounts
Depth charges (not implemented)

The ship is not armored at all. Its only protection is its large size - any single hit won't do much damage to such a large object unless it hits something critical. Because of this HE shells are a bigger danger to it than AP shells (true for any destroyer, though cruiser+ sized ships have armor and are protected against HE).
The gun is NOT the same as on monitor, while it uses the same rounds, it has longer range (monitor guns are 102mm/45, which allows for elevation of up to +60 degrees). Proper max range for 102/60: 16090 meters (at +30 degree elevation which is the max the mount allows, and 823m/s muzzle velocity).
