Weapons:
1 x 40-K 45mm gun turret
1 x 41-K twin 45mm guns turret (the same guns as in 40-K, but 2 of them in a turret)
2 x 70-K 37mm AA gun in open mount (the same as 61-K light AA gun)
1 x MK-2-4 102mm gun turret (main turret, 2 B-2 102mm guns in it. RoF = 5-6 rounds per minute per gun)
4 x 12.7mm MG - 2 in armored turrets, 2 in open mounts

45mm guns are basically the same as in T-70, but they can elevate high enough to provide some AA fire.
Main guns can elevate to +60 degrees and so can also fire AA (if only it had RoF necessary for that task...)
In fact all the weapons can be used for air defence, though 102mm and 45mm guns aren't particularly good at it.
102mm guns have no AP rounds, they only have HE (plus HE-frag, plus special things like illumination or chemical rounds, etc. We don't want to have those :) ). Max range (at 755 m/s muzzle velocity with HE round) - 16470 meters.

Weapon arrangement for script:
Weapon1 - main turret
Weapon2 - forward 45mm turret (2-gun one)
Weapon3 - rear 45mm turret
Weapon4 - forward MG turret
Weapon5 - rear MG turret
Weapon6 - first AA gun
Weapon7 - second AA gun
Weapon8 - top AA MG
Weapon9 - rear AA MG

Armor: 16mm main belt, 4mm deck and hull ends. The hull is divided into 13 compartments, which make it quite hard to sink.
I don't know what this should be in HP, that kind of armor provides good protection against small arms fire and fragments, but really no defence against any kind of AP shells. Large size however means it should take a lot of AP hits to sink.

Speed: 15 knots (=15 mph)
Crew: 83 (this should have a reflection on HP btw)
