Weapons:
1 x 40-K 45mm gun turret
1 x 41-K twin 45mm guns turret (the same guns as in 40-K, but 2 of them in a turret)
2 x 70-K 37mm AA gun in open mount (the same as 61-K light AA gun)
1 x MK-2-4 102mm gun turret (main turret, 2 guns in it)
4 x 12.7mm MG - 2 in armored turrets, 2 in open mounts

45mm guns are basically the same as in T-70, but they can elevate high enough to provide AA fire.
Main guns can elevate to +60 degrees and so can also fire AA
In fact all the weapons can be used for air defence, though 102mm and 45mm guns aren't particularly good at it.
